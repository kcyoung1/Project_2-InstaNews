<h1>Project 2 - InstaNews</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For our second project, we created a responsive single page website building on our HTML/CSS skills and incorporating Ajax, JSON, and API concepts. The site dynamically populates a grid of news stories from the NY Times website based on what topic the user selected in the drop down select box. We added a jQuery plugin to style our select button, to dynamically change the NY Times logo from large to small when a topic is selected and a loader gif when the stories are being populated.</p>

<h2>Languages and tools used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS/SASS (animations)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Ajax/JSON</li>
<li>Git/Github</li>
</ul>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>During this project, I learned how to incorporate ajax into my website to pull information from an API. It was difficult to wrap my head around how to access specific information from a JSON object but it solidified my understanding of objects and arrays and I look forward to working with API's in the future. </p>
<p>The addition of gulp and browsersync in this project made life much easier as we didn't have to manually refresh our pages. Learning how to code CSS using SASS also saved a great deal of time.</p>
